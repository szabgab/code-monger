# NOTE: This script is used by puppet/cron jobs.

# This wrapper script sets up the environment to run other local (repo) scripts.
# We need to use ./bin/carton to get the custom PERL_CARTON_PATH env var
# (where modules are installed).
# We also either need to chdir so that cpanfile is in $PWD
# or we need to determine the full path and set an env var.
# Changing to this dir is convenient for making shorter command lines,
# so we'll do that.

# Change to the parent dir of this script
# whether called with full, relative, or no path.

# Load perl env if necessary.

# Run through carton exec (which expects ./cpanfile) to get the custom lib path.
