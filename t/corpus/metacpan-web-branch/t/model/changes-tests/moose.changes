  [ENHANCEMENTS]

  * add_method now accepts blessed subs (Graham Knop, PR#28)

  [BUG FIXES]

  * If a role consumed another role, we resolve method conflicts just like a
    class consuming a role, but when metaclass compat tried to fix up
    metaclass roles, we were putting all methods into one composite role and
    allowing methods in the metaclass roles to conflict. Now we resolve them
    as we should. (Jesse Luehrs, PR#27)

  * Some edge cases in tests with base.pm and non-existent module files are
    handled more strictly (see also perl RT#118561) (Graham Knop, PR#25)

2.1004 Fri, Jul 26, 2013

  [BUG FIXES]

  * 2.1003 was released with some bad metadata, which caused the prereq test
    to fail.
