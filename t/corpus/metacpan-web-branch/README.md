## GETTING STARTED

We strongly recommend using [metacpan-developer](https://github.com/CPAN-API/metacpan-developer),
this will give you a virtual machine already configured and ready to start developing on.

    $ vagrant ssh
    $ cd /home/metacpan/metacpan.org
    $ perl bin/daemon_control.pl start

You'll find some log files in var/logs.

## Installing manually

If you prefer not to use the VM, the following commands will get you started:
commands can be converted to:

    $ carton install
    $ ./bin/prove t
    $ carton exec plackup -p 5001 -r

## Local configuration changes

The backend defaults to `api.metacpan.org`. Running a local API server is
optional and not required to hack on the front-end.  The address to the API
user can be changed in the `metacpan_web.conf` file.  Ideally you would create a
new file called `metacpan_web_local.conf` that contains

    api                 http://127.0.0.1:5000
    api_external        http://127.0.0.1:5000
    api_secure          http://127.0.0.1:5000
    api_external_secure http://127.0.0.1:5000

which will be loaded on top of the existing config file.


## COMPATIBILITY NOTES

On Win32 (and possibly also on other platforms) when using Perl < 5.12, the
server started with plackup will generate warnings relating to date parsing.
These are caused by Plack due to a bug in the gmtime implementation and can be
removed by upgrading to Perl 5.12.
