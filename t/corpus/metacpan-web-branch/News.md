Title: Let's move to Bootstrap 3
------------------------------
Date: 2014-08-06T08:55:22

MetaCPAN has moved to Bootstrap 3 as well as introducing cool icons from [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/). Let's make MetaCPAN be more colorful!

Title: Link to Task::Kensho is now available on home page and no result page
------------------------------
Date: 2014-06-14T23:25:11

If youâ€™re absolute newbies who're not even sure what to search, it will be good idea to take a look at [Task::Kensho!](https://metacpan.org/pod/Task::Kensho) We provide a link to the module in both Home page and No result page with the idea to help CPAN beginners to get started.

Title: Faster with Fastly
------------------------------
Date: 2014-06-14T18:44:15

You may have noticed an increase in speed for https://metacpan.org/
since the 22nd of May, this is because the site is now served
through [Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/). Fastly are providing this
service free of charge. We are not fully utilising is yet (we don't
let Fastly cache much), but it makes all sorts of things easier
for us and we will be able to do even more for you with it in the future.

Title: Suggestion on incorrect number of colons
------------------------------
Date: 2014-06-09T08:15:00

Perl module name should contain only 2 colons, some common mistakes are we underuse or overuse it. Now, suggestion on no result page available when search with missing colon such as [Test:More](https://metacpan.org/search?q=Test%3AMore) or too much colons like [DBIx:::Class::::ResultSet](https://metacpan.org/search?q=DBIx%3A%3A%3AClass%3A%3A%3A%3AResultSet).

Title: Table sorting is now persistent
------------------------------
Date: 2014-05-19T10:50:12

When you change the sorting of a table it will be saved in your
browser's localStorage so that the next time you view that particular table
it will remember your last preference.  This is saved on a per table basis
(for example, author releases, author favorites, and reverse dependency releases).
No need to set it every time when accessing that page in the same browser.

Title: Details of (++)plussers displayed
------------------------------
Date: 2014-05-12T18:40:17

To get a better insight of which Pause users have ++ed a particular distribution, a list of their gravatar images is displayed.
Also, the count of non-Pause plussers makes it easier to know how many users have liked the module.

Hence, it gives us a perception of the people who recommend the module.


Title: Dependency Graphs are Here
------------------------------
Date: 2014-05-13T20:50:10

Jeffrey Thalhammer took the time this week to contribute dependency graphs to
MetaCPAN.  The graphs are hosted by [Stratopan](http://stratopan.com) and they
can be found on module and release pages under the "Reverse Dependencies" link.

Thanks very much to [THALJEF](https://metacpan.org/author/THALJEF) for
implementing this new feature.
