We want to keep the issue list manageable, so we can focus on what actually
needs fixing.  If you feel an issue needs opening again, please add a comment
explaining why it needs re-opening and we'll look at it again.

 * Issues will be closed and moved to [Wishlist](https://github.com/CPAN-API/cpan-api/wiki/Wishlist) if they are not actual bugs
 * Issues we think we have addressed will be closed
 * Issues we are not going to take any further action on without more information will be closed
