# FAQ's answered

## What third-party sites does MetaCPAN use?

* [CPAN](http://www.cpan.org/) is where all the Perl modules live.
MetaCPAN 'just' indexes those files.
* [Perlybook](http://perlybook.org/) provides the MOBI and EPUB download capabilities.
MetaCPAN provides direct links to download the POD in the respective formats.
* [CPAN Testers](http://www.cpantesters.org/) collect test reports of the CPAN modules.
MetaCPAN show the number of test reports and links to the tests.
* [CPANTS](http://cpants.cpanauthors.org/) provide Kwalitee metrics for CPAN modules.
MetaCPAN links to the respective pages on the CPANTS site.
* [CPAN Ratings](http://cpanratings.perl.org/) allows users to give stars and review CPAN distributions.
MetaCPAN show the average rating using stars and links to the reviews.
* [search.cpan.org](http://search.cpan.org/) is another search engine for the same data.
It is older, but the source code has not been published.
MetaCPAN links to the respective page of each module/distribution.
* [RT](https://rt.cpan.org/) is an installation of [Request Tracker](https://www.bestpractical.com/rt/)
that provides a default bug~ and issue-tracking system for every CPAN distribution.
Unless the author of the module configured it otherwise MetaCPAN will link the respective RT Queue
of every distribution.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) is the most popular public version control system among Perl module developers.
Many distributions indicate it as their public VCS. Some of them even mark GitHub as their preferred
issue tracking system. MetaCPAN links to the GitHub repository and bug tracking system of each distributions
if the author has included the information in the META files.

## How to list all the Plack Middleware?

Search for <a href="/search?q=module:Plack::Middleware">module:Plack::Middleware</a>

## In general, how to list all the modules in a name-space?

Type in <em>module:</em> and the namespace such as <a href="/search?q=module:Catalyst::Plugin">Catalyst::Plugin</a>,
<a href="/search?q=module:Dancer::Plugin">Dancer::Plugin</a>,
<a href="/search?q=module:Mojolicious::Plugin">Mojolicious::Plugin</a>,
or <a href="/search?q=module:Perl::Critic::Policy">Perl::Critic::Policy</a>.

## A non-comprehensive list of special search expressions:

These search-terms can be combined with each other and regular search term.

* <em>module:</em>  filter by part of a  module name ( e.g. [module:Plugin](/search?q=module:Plugin) )
* <em>distribution:</em> search in the files of the specific distribution ( e.g. [distribution:Dancer auth](/search?q=distribution%3ADancer+auth) )
* <em>author:</em> search in the modules releases by the given author ( e.g. [author:SONGMU Redis](/search?q=author%3ASONGMU+Redis) )
* <em>version:</em> limit the search to modules with the given version number ( e.g. [version:1.00](/search?q=version%3A1.00) )

Wildcards: ? matches a single character, * matches any number of characters
( e.g. [version:1.*](/search?q=version%3A1.*) and [version:1.?](/search?q=version%3A1.?) ) 

## Why can't I find a specific module?

See our [missing module](/about/missing_modules) page.

## How can I get involved / who is involved?

* [Contact us](/about/contact)
* [Development information](/about/development)
* [Who else has contributed?](/about/contributors)

## Where can I find the API docs?

The API docs can be found [on the wiki](https://github.com/CPAN-API/cpan-api/wiki/API-docs).
API requests need to be sent to api.metacpan.org.

## How can I try the API?

[http://explorer.metacpan.org/](http://explorer.metacpan.org/) is an easy way
to try sending queries to the back-end.

## Why can't I link my PAUSE account?

### Is your PAUSE email set up?

If you are a module author you can link your [PAUSE](http://pause.perl.org/)
account to your MetaCPAN account. But you must configure the email address
forwarding in your PAUSE account for this to work.

### Do you have multiple accounts?

If you can only connect your account to github <em>or</em> PAUSE
(e.g. connecting to one disconnects the other), it is usually because
you have 2 accounts.

To fix this

 * log in with one of them
 * go to identities and disconnect that account
 * log in with the other and connect to the first

### Still have problems? Favorites not displaying on author page?

Please see [this discussion](https://github.com/CPAN-API/metacpan-web/issues/852).

## Oops! I made a mistake.  Can you delete my module?

Requests to have modules removed from the CPAN should be directed at the PAUSE
admins.  Keep in mind that, if a module contains sensitive information, just
deleting it from your CPAN directory is not enough, as it will still reside in
the BackPAN.

If the PAUSE admins approve your request, have them CC noc@metacpan.org so that
we can push the right buttons to have your work removed from MetaCPAN as well.

## Can I _automatically_ redirect links pointing at search.cpan.org to metacpan.org?

For Chrome users, the [MetaCPAN
Helper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metacpan-helper/aoioenbjpmccpkincghhjfmeceknpcnb)
extension will automatically rewrite search.cpan.org links to MetaCPAN.

You can accomplish the same thing by modifying your <code>hosts</code> file.
Add the following lines and all links to search.cpan.org (and links to source
code) will be redirected to MetaCPAN:

    46.43.35.68 search.cpan.org
    46.43.35.68 cpansearch.perl.org

If you do this, be sure to point cpanm to another mirror, as it defaults to
search.cpan.org. Here's how:

    export PERL_CPANM_OPT="--mirror http://www.cpan.no/" # Insert your closest mirror here.

## Can I _manually_ redirect links pointing at search.cpan.org to metacpan.org?

If you find yourself to be on search.cpan.org and you want to get redirected to
corresponding metacpan page, just change the domain name with
search.**m**cpan.org. For example:

    http://search.cpan.org/~xsawyerx/MetaCPAN-API-0.43/lib/MetaCPAN/API.pm

has to be changed to:

    http://search.mcpan.org/~xsawyerx/MetaCPAN-API-0.43/lib/MetaCPAN/API.pm
                  ^
