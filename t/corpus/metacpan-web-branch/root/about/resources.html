# Source Code

MetaCPAN consists of two projects:

## Front-end

This is what you are looking at right now. The source code is on [github](https://github.com/CPAN-API/metacpan-web).

## Back-end

The front-end is a slim wrapper around the back-end. It provides a REST API to data around CPAN and its ecosystem. The code is also on [github](https://github.com/CPAN-API/cpan-api).
